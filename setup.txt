#Dockerfile this?


#Frontend Setup

yarn add babel-cli babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react --dev
echo '{ "presets": ["react","env"] }' > .babelrc
git init .
echo 'dist/\nnode_modules' > .gitignore

yarn add webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server style-loader css-loader
#also see package.json and webpack.config.js for config setups.
yarn add less --dev

#see package.json for scripts we've setup.
#see index.json header of comments for more frontend stuff

#Backend Setup

#see dockerfile, docker-compose
#docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up for DEV mode -- second config has stuff that overrides first
#run yarn server with: yarn server. Build static files with: yarn build.
#docker-compose up or docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up for production
#next time maybe have custom nginx config to serve "/dist" instead of "/static", & have flask server fallback
#to serving it.
#also should configure nginx to serve .gz versions of files.
#use requirements.txt and RUN pip install line immediately after to prevent docker cache invalidation

#Server

# see http://christopher5106.github.io/continous/deployment/2016/05/11/google-appengine-is-simply-brillant-tutorial.html
# essentially is app.yml "gloud app deploy app.yml"
# data is such that a startup script will download the data if there is none
# in the data directory. So use the dev docker-compose which will mount this folder
# which has data as a volume.
# docker stats memory usage is inaccurate.
# if want consistent testing, make sure in docker preferences on Mac that the CPu count, memory, and swap is the same
# as on the GAEApp. there's no swap on GAE instances...
# be sure to check nameservers and whatnot for domain -- shouldn't take more than 5 min if testing on Google DNS.
# GAE acts as a load balancer and forwards to nginx headers such as $http_x_forwarded_proto -- client protocol, $http_x_forwarded_for -- client ip
# to clear service cache and whatnot, service restart not service start
# there's some sort of cache of / on client not refreshed with Ctrl-Cmdr-R. Prob because it's <1kb.
# FF focus on Android doesn't have this problem, doesn't automatically choose https so good for testing.
